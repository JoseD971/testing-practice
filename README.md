# Testing Practice

## Description

This project contains several utility functions that perform operations on numbers and strings. The functions are:

1. **`analyzeArray`**: Analyzes an array of numbers and returns an object with statistical properties like average, minimum, maximum, and length.
2. **`caesarCipher`**: Encrypts a string using the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption method by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
3. **`capitalize`**: Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
4. **`reverseString`**: Reverses the characters in a string.
5. **`calculator`**: Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Project Features

- Provides utility functions for manipulating strings and performing basic arithmetic operations.
